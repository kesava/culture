  <p>Here is my list of 100+ notable Telugu movies:<br><strong>Summary Statistics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>1940s - 3</li>
<li>1950s - 15</li>
<li>1960s - 23</li>
<li>1970s - 32</li>

<li>2000s - 15</li>
<li>2010s - 15</li>
<li>2020s - 2</li>
</ul>
<p>1942 - <strong>Bhakta Pothana</strong> - This is legendary KV Reddy‚Äôs first movie. Chittoor V Nagayya has cinematically defined Pothana for eternity.<br>1945 - <strong>Swarga Seema</strong> - First telugu movie to be nominated for a foreign film festival. Ghantasala makes debut.<br>1946 - <strong>Tyagayya</strong> - Chittoor V Nagayya‚Äôs performance is sublime and purity personified. The movie has some of the best bhavayukta reneditions of Saint Tyagaraja‚Äôs compositions</p>
<p>1950 - <strong>Shavukaru</strong> - A wedding disrupted by a village feud. Pretty typical in that sense. But stark realistic portrayal for its time.<br>1951 - <strong>Malleeswari</strong> - The movie is from an era when the director (BN Reddy) let actors (NTR and Bhanumathi) actually take time to express their romantic feelings towards one another. Some amazing songs by S Rajeswara Rao and Devulapalli Krishna Sastry.<br>1951 - <strong>Paatala Bhairavi</strong> - Alladin and the magic lamp rehashed for Telugu audience. SV Ranga Rao and NT Rama Rao give classic performances. Pingali Nagendra Rao‚Äôs phrases get added to the Telugu lexicon.<br>1953 - <strong>Devadasu</strong> - ANR cements his position as the eternal lover in Telugu cinema.<br>1953 - **Pakka Inti Ammayi **- Anjali Devi, Relangi and AM Rajah play the first version of Padosan. Well, Padosan was derived from this original.</p>
<p>1954 - <strong>Pedda Manushulu</strong> - Another KV Reddy‚Äôs masterpiece. With great cast including Jandhyala Gaurinatha Sastry, Mudigonda Lingamurthy, Relangi, Vangara Venkata Subbayya - this movie holds a mirror to a slice of society from 50s.<br>1955 - <strong>Missamma</strong> - Way ahead of its time and yet successfully captivates it audience. Progressive men and women, inter-religion interaction‚Ä¶ its got all, packaged into good family entertainer. NTR, ANR, SVR, Savitri and Jamuna. Yes, the whole package. The missing piece - Ghantasala. AM Raja sings instead. He is not bad either.<br>1955 - <strong>Donga Ramudu</strong> - Another great KV Reddy movie. The movie introduced new phrases into Telugu lexicon - ‚ÄúSambarala Rambabu‚Äù, ‚ÄúGas kottadam‚Äù, ‚ÄúBabul debba, golconda abba‚Äù. The song ‚ÄúChiguraakulalo Chilakamma‚Äù lives forever.<br>1955 - <strong>Anarkali</strong> - the story of Saleem and Anarkali. Much earlier than Mughal-e-Azam. SV Ranga Rao as Akbar is Prithvi Raj Kapoor‚Äôs match. P. Adinaraya Rao is Naushad‚Äôs disciple. His ‚ÄúRajasekhara Nee Pai Moju Teeraledu raa‚Ä¶‚Äù is a haunting classic.<br>1955 - <strong>Kanyasulkam</strong> - This film adaptation of G.V.Apparow‚Äôs (Gurazada Appa Rao) play is a masterpiece in acting and screenplay adaptation. Veteran actors like Vinnakota Ramanna Pantulu, Vangara Venkata Subbayya and CS Rao give NTR a run for money.<br>1956 -** Tenali Ramakrishna **- The casting cannot get any better. ANR as the wise-cracking witty poet, NTR as Krishna Deva, Chittoor Nagayya as Minister Thimmarusu and Bhanumati as the spy. Great poetry from the Vijayanagara court. Sivaji Ganesan plays the poet in the Tamil version, and I have to say ANR shines better.</p>
<p>1957 - <strong>Thodi Kodallu</strong> - One of the first joint family problem fixing movies.<br>1957 - <strong>Maaya Bazaar</strong> - Perhaps the greatest Telugu cinema ever! The movie takes characters from Mahabharatha and cooks its own delightful recipe making them telugu instead of Aryan. Pingali Nagendra Rao concocts new telugu words for the movie. Ghantasala and S.Rajeswara Rao(uncredited) composed ever lasting melodies. NTR defines Krishna for a whole culture. SVR and Savitri play their roles interchangeably transitioning into each other seamlessly. Widely acclaimed and wildly popular.</p>
<p>1957 -** Suvarna Sundari** - A rehash of Sakuntala-Dushyantha story. Hauting music from Adi Narayana Rao.<br>1958 - <strong>Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu</strong> - Another classic Vijaya comedy preaching about ill-effects of debt.<br>1958 - <strong>Maangalya Balam</strong> - Tries to re-iterate the age-old Indian wisdom of marriages are timeless. Absolutely terrific music.</p>
<p>1960 - <strong>Mahakavi Kalidasu</strong> - Akkineni Nageswara Rao is outstanding as the great poet. Sivaji Ganesan played the part in Tamil and Rajkumar in Kannada. But ANR displays a particular unmatched angst of illiterate man being bestowed by Saraswathi herself.<br>1961 - <strong>Jagadekaveeruni Katha</strong> - Another KV Reddy classic and a blockbuster hit for its time. The movie features one of Ghanatasala/Pendyala‚Äôs all time great song - <em>Siva Sankari</em>. The lead role‚Äôs name Pratap, perhaps comes from 1951 MGR hit - <em>Sarvadhikari</em>.<br>1961 - <strong>Seetarama Kalyanam</strong> - Ravana playing Rudraveena is pretty fantastic.<br>1962 - <strong>Gulebakavali Katha</strong> - The great song writer C. Narayana Reddy makes his debut.<br>1962 - <strong>Gundamma Katha</strong> - Gundamma tries to get her daughters married off. A timeless classic. NTR, ANR, SVR, Savitri and Jamuna. The standard package along with Suryakantam as termagant Gundamma. A whole culture refused to name their daughters Suryakantham after this movie.</p>
<p>1962 - <strong>Dakshayagnam</strong> - A very stage play reproduction of Siva vs Dakshya, excellently portrayed by NTR and SVR. The film features a lot of stage artists like Kanchu Kantam P Suri Babu.<br>1963 - <strong>Mooga Manasulu</strong> - Eloquently picturized muted love. ANR, Savitri and Jamuna give some timeless performances.</p>
<p>1963 - <strong>Chaduvukunna Ammayilu</strong> - Just the title suffices notability.<br>1963 -** Lava Kusa** - It is common to see multiple film depictions of chapters from Ramayana and Mahabharatha. But no body else dared to do Uththara Kanda after the wild success of this one. NT Rama Rao plays Sree Rama in viyoga. Ghantasala and Samudrala simplify Ramayana into spoken word set to hummable music. HUGE hit for its time.</p>
<p>1963 - <strong>Narthanasaala</strong> - Classic adaptation of ‚ÄúVirata Parva‚Äù chapter from the great epic Mahabharatha. SV Ranga Rao adds a master stroke of genius to the villainy of Keechaka. NT Rama Rao excels playing the trans-gender dance teacher - Brihannala. Mangalampalli Bala Murali Krishna lends his voice to an exceptionally beautiful song - ‚ÄòSalalitha Raaga Sudha Raasa Saaram‚Äô. The movie uses a lot of original poetry written by Tikkana Somayaji from Andhra Mahabharatham..<br>1964 - <strong>Ramudu Bheemudu</strong> - Although ANR did the first double action in Telugu cinema, this NTR starrer spawned off popular double action movies in Tamil and Hindi.<br>1964 - <strong>Dr. Chakravarthy</strong> - Platonic love in Telugu cinema.<br>1965 - <strong>Pandava Vanavaasam</strong> - Another excellent adaptation of a chapter, Aranyaka Parva, from the Mahabharata. Savitri and NT Rama Rao play Draupadi and Bheema sena hyper imaginatively. Ghantasala provides anachronistic music with guitars. NTR performs an forceful rendition of ‚ÄúDharuni Rajya Sampada‚Äù, in an extra-ordinary reaction scene to that performance, SVR says ‚ÄúHa, Baaniselu‚Äù. This made every one dread working with SVR‚Äôs fierce reactions.</p>
<p>1965 -** Satya Harischandra** - The legendary KV Reddy‚Äôs latter masterpiece.<br>1966 - <strong>Sri Krishna Pandaveeyam</strong> - NTR accomplishes something amazing - director and dual role in the movie. Pretty much monopolized the roles of Krishna and Duryodhana for the rest of the human history.<br>1966 - <strong>Sri Krishna Tulabharam</strong> - Jamuna immortalizes Satyabhama. Narada (T Kanta Rao) auctioning off Krishna (NTR) and Yadavas protesting against it - is genius.<br>1966 - <strong>Gudachari 116</strong> - The first spy genre movie in Telugu. Krishna himself made numerous spy films through out his career, but this movie also triggered the spy genre in hindi with the super hit remake <em>Farz</em>.<br>1967 - <strong>Sudigundalu</strong> - Great court drama from 60s questioning law and justice. Directed by Adurti Subba Rao and written by K.Viswanth. Akkineni Nagarjuna also makes a debut.</p>
<p>1967 - <strong>Sri Krishnavataram</strong> - Film adaptation of Krishna‚Äôs story includes the wildly popular Tirupati Venkata Kavula version of Udyoga Parvam. Cant stop listening to those padyamulu.<br>1967 - <strong>Bhaktha Prahlada</strong> - SV Ranga Raa‚Äôs performance and S. Rajeswara Rao‚Äôs music are the stars of this movie. Pothana‚Äôs poetry brings extra ordinary authenticity to the devotion.<br>1967 - <strong>Saakshi</strong> - One of the many movies that capture village politics. What distinguishes this one is the raw performances of Krishna and Vijaya Nirmala.</p>
<p>1968 - <strong>Lakshmi Nivasam</strong> - SV Ranga Rao teaches protestant work ethic and financial literacy to his kids.<br>1969 - <strong>BudhidhiManthudu</strong> - What should the village spend its resources on? A temple or a school? Akkineni Nageswara Rao plays a double role as if not to offend either parties.</p>
<p>1971 - <strong>Dasara Bullodu</strong> - The smashest of hits. Becomes a phrase in Telugu lexicon.<br>1971 - <strong>Mosagallaki Mosagadu</strong> - One of the first and most successful Westerns made for Telugu cinema.<br>1971 - <strong>Prem Nagar</strong> - ANR reprises the devadas character. This time its only a much bigger hit.<br>1971 - <strong>Sampoorna Ramayanam</strong> - Poetic, poetic and poetic. Poetic written all over it, this is probably the best film depiction of Ramayana ever, riddled with mellifluous poems and songs. SV Ranga Rao gives a stellar performance as Ravana.</p>
<p>1972 - <strong>Badi Panthulu</strong> - NTR plays an aging school teacher in this tear jerking family drama. Sridevi makes her debut as a child artist.<br>1972 - <strong>Tata Manavadu</strong> - SV Ranga Rao gives yet another memorable performance as a the head of the family. Great philosophical songs too. Directed by Dasari Narayana Rao.<br>1972 - <strong>Bala Bharatam</strong> - Young Kauravas and Paandavas compete to make a white elephant. Sparks child imagination and curiosity with a whole bag of tricks.<br>1973 - <strong>Andala Ramudu</strong> - A boat tour on the river Godavari to Bhadrachalam. Bapu and Mullapudi yet to shake off the Ramayana intoxication.</p>
<p>1973 - <strong>Neramu Siksha</strong> - K Viswanth‚Äôs adaptation of Dostoyevsky‚Äôs Crime and Punishment.<br>1974 - <strong>Alluri Seetarama Raju</strong> - Krishna‚Äôs attempt to portray the life of the great local patriotic hero. Won kudos from the great NTR.<br>1975 - <strong>Thota Ramudu</strong> - Chalam had a niche movie corner for himself amongst the stars of the day. Features some memorable music by Sathyam.<br>1975 - <strong>Muthyala Muggu</strong> - Bapu-Ramana actually never shook off the Ramayana intoxication. Rao Gopala Rao gives an amazing debut performance. Only self-plug: my grandmother‚Äôs brother acted as the Pujari in the movie.</p>
<p>1975 - <strong>Jeevana Jyothi</strong> - VaniSree gives an excellent performance of experiencing child loss. K Viswanath ushers the era of female crowd pullers.<br>1976 - <strong>Sree Rajeswari Coffee Vilas Club</strong> - Missamma after a couple of decades. G. Varalakshmi excels in the matriarch role.<br>1976 - <strong>Prema Bandham</strong> - K Viswanath has done some real fine work outside his musical genre. This one two outstanding characters portrayed by Sowcar Janaki and Kaikala Satyanarayana. Also, the year Jayaprada‚Äôs career took off, isn it?<br>1976 -** Seeta Kalyanam** - An aesthetic feat in filming a Hindu wedding.</p>
<p>1976 - <strong>Siri Siri Muvva</strong> - K Viswanath‚Äôs aarangetram into the musical genre of films.<br>1976 -** Bhakta Kannappa** - Bapu/Ramana shift their focus to a non-Ramayana/Mahabharata story for once. Memorable music by Sathyam.<br>1977 - <strong>Dana Veera Soora Karna</strong> - NTR ups his own game by directing the movie as well as playing three pivotal roles in the movie - Krishna, Duryodhana and Karna himself. Sivaji Ganesan‚Äôs portrayal of Karna in 1963 Karnan may be the only match to this performance of Karna.<br>1977 - <strong>Chankya Chandra Gupta</strong> - Sivaji Ganesan plays Alexander adding to the already illustrious performances of Chanakya by ANR and Chandragupta Maurya by NTR</p>
<p>1977 - <strong>Yama Gola</strong> - Another endearing Telugu genre - human tryst with the Lord of death - Yama Dharma Raja. NTR preaches democracy and socialism to the netherworlds of Yama. DV Narasa Raju writes <em>the</em> finest satire in Telugu cinema, on Hindu mythology and the contemporary politics of the ‚Äô77 emergency era in the NTR-visits-Naraka episode.<br>1977 - <strong>Adavi Ramudu</strong> - Bell bottoms, wigs, young heroines and heavy dialog gives NT Rama Rao a new lease on his acting life. The movie also introduced Veturi Sundarama Murthy to a wider audience.<br>1978 - <strong>Vetagadu</strong> - The movie catapults NT Rama Rao from mega super star to mega bumper super star or whatever.<br>1978 - <strong>Maro Charitra</strong> - A tamil boy and telugu girl fall in love and their story ends in a terrible tragedy. Launches the Telugu career of the great Kamal Hassan. Was later re-made as Ek Duje Ke Liye in Hindi which launched his Hindi career. Love story across languages was an innovation for its time.</p>
<p>1978 - <strong>Manavoori Pandavulu</strong> - Bapu-Mullapudi change gears to Mahabharatha and rehash Saakshi with more characters.<br>1978 - <strong>Anugraham</strong> - Shyam Benegal makes a movie adaptation of Blockbuster Marathi novel ‚ÄúKondura‚Äù.<br>1979 - <strong>Idi Katha Kaadu</strong> - A divorced single mom (Jayasudha) tries to raise her child. Chiranjeevi plays a villain and Kamal Hassan a ventriloquist.<br>1979 - <strong>Maa Bhoomi</strong> - Gautam Ghose makes his debut with part-documentary and part-feature-fim portrayal of subsistence farmers under a feudalistic society in pre-independence Telangana. Vinjamuri Seeta Devi, who later, chronicled ‚ÄúFolk Music of Andhra Pradesh‚Äù has composed music for this super hit, in its times. Singer of Pubic Square, Gaddar also makes an appearance in the movie.<br>1979 - <strong>Guppedu Manasu</strong> - Simultaneously shot as <em>Nool Veli</em> in Tamil, is a great psychological drama aptly penned by Kannadasan/Atreya in the song ‚ÄúMounathil Vilayadum‚Äù / ‚ÄúMouname Nee Bhasha‚Äù.<br>1979 - <strong>Andamaina Anubhavam</strong> - Simultaneously shot as <em>Ninaithile Inikkum</em>, this is the last multi-starrer with Rajinikanth and Kamal Hassan.<br>1979 - <strong>Sankarabharanam</strong> - The movie starts with an adage: ‚ÄúAnimals, babies and humans. All of them enjoy music‚Äù. The movie sets out to demonstrate that adage with out any big stars except of course soulful music. Somayajulu gets type casted for life.</p>
<p>1980 - <strong>Vamsa Vriksham</strong> - Women‚Äôs rights in a patriarchal society screaming for a male child.<br>1980 - <strong>Sapthapadi</strong> - A deep reflection piece on caste, marriage and karma. Well articulated with out being preachy both through dialog and songs.<br>1981 - <strong>Aakali Rajyam</strong> - Srirangam Srinivasa Rao‚Äôs vast body of blood-boiling literary work gives voice to Kamal‚Äôs starving hunger. Scathing satire on the unemployment problems of 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>1981 - <strong>Thyagayya</strong> - Classic but pales in comparision to the Nagayya version. Comprehensive representation of popular Tyagaraja krithis.<br>1982 - <strong>Naalugu Sthambhala Aata</strong> - Redefined ‚Äòlove story‚Äô in Telugu cinema. Pretty much the first modern love story in which kids revolt their parents‚Äô decisions. Also introduced ‚Äú‡∞∏‡±Å‡∞§‡±ç‡∞§‡∞ø‡∞ï‡±ä‡∞ü‡±ç‡∞ü‡±Å‚Äù* *telugu lexicon.<br>1982 - <strong>Bobbili Puli</strong> - NT Rama Rao is catapulted into Andhra Pradesh politics with this movie.<br>1982 - <strong>Subhalekha</strong> - One of the non-preachy and yet impactful movies that wage a war against dowry, a phenomenally evil social menace in the 80s. Young Chiranjeevi is still malleable and ductile.</p>
<p>1983 - <strong>Khaidi</strong> - Chiranjeevi, yet another hero is now called the supreme hero.<br>1983 - <strong>Meghasandesam</strong> - Nageswara Rao plays a struggling poet who is newly inspired by a temple dancer ensuring some family melodrama.<br>1983 - <strong>Saagara Sangamam</strong> - Talented dancer who seem to have everything under the sun loses all of it. Heart-wrenching performances, soulful dance and music sequences, out of world background score, good dialog and movie ending with ‚ÄòNo End‚Äô. Too many great things to mention in a paragraph!<br>1984 - <strong>Srivariki Premalekha</strong> - Introduced the concept of low budget full length dialog and character comedy. Guaranteed laugh riots.<br>1984 - <strong>Mayuri</strong> - Autobiographical movie of dancer Sudha Chandran who overcame her physical disability of a lost leg.<br>1985 - <strong>Vijetha</strong> - The movie starts with Chiranjeevi‚Äôs plead to his fans to let him experiment outside his standard fare. If only his fans agreed to the plead! Great supporting cast from Urvasi Sarada and Somayajulu and dialogues by Jandhyala. One of Chiranjeevi‚Äôs finest movies.<br>1986 - <strong>Swathi Muthyam</strong> - 1986 was also the year the novel ‚ÄúForrest Gump‚Äù was published. So much for coincidence. Kamal Hassan and Ilaiyaraaja easily outperform Tom Hanks and Alan Silvestri.</p>
<p>1986 - <strong>Chantabbai</strong> - Chiranjeevi plays a bumbling crime detective with no macho what-so-ever. Many classic comedy scenes. Chiranjeevi‚Äôs portrayal of Charlie Chaplin in a song is a classic and has inspired Kamal Hassan‚Äôs similar portrayal in a Tamil movie ‚ÄúPunnagai Mannan‚Äù.<br>1986 - <strong>Sirivennela</strong> - A deaf and dumb photographer falls in love with a blind flutist. But the audience get an absolute sensory overload with never-before written music and words.<br>1987 - <strong>Padamati Sandhya Raagam</strong> - Pioneering movie about East meets West, telugu style. Made ‚ÄúThe States‚Äù tangible to Telugu people for the first time.

Timeless comedy which introduced new analogies to Telugu lexicon.</p>
<p>1987 - <strong>Swayam Krushi</strong> - A rags-to-riches story of a shoemaker who has an absolutely brilliant way of venting out his frustration. The movie almost feels like semi-autobiography of Chiranjeevi.<br>1988 - <strong>Choopulu Kalasina Subhavela</strong> - Another set of great comic caricatures.<br>1988 - <strong>Rudra Veena</strong> - Son of a Carnatic music legend challenges tradition and loses his inheritance. or does he really? His definitive ideas about his village‚Äôs social progress take shape into reality bringing fame back to his legendary dad. Ilaiyaraaja brings carnatic musical spring to the masses.

Prince of Persia meets Telugu cinema, Only better. Way better.<br>2010 - <strong>Maryada Ramanna</strong> - A pretty good execution of a very simple premise - the protagonist can‚Äôt leave the house unless he wants to be killed.<br>2011 - <strong>Sri Rama Rajyam</strong> - Bapu actually dares to remake the timeless inimitable classic Lava Kusa for 21st century and succeeds to a great extent. Bala Krishna carries off his dad‚Äôs heritage with certain elegance.<br>2012 - <strong>Eega</strong> - A bugs life meets Telugu love story. Anthropomorphic characters in Telugu cinema for the first time.<br>2012 - <strong>Mithunam</strong> - An elderly couple make the best for each other after the nest empties. Sunsets are indeed beautiful.</p>
<p>2015 - <strong>Baahubali (The Beginning)</strong> - ‚ÄúWait, Telugu people make good movies?‚Äù<br>2017 - <strong>Baahubali (The Conclusion) **- ‚ÄúSaaho Rey, Baahubali!‚Äù. The coronation act is no less compelling than the best of Game of Thrones.<br>2017 - **Fidaa</strong> - The strong female lead this time is a Telangana poree. Super hit songs in Telangana dialect for the first time.</p>
<p>2017 - <strong>Arjun Reddy</strong> - Devadas isn‚Äôt a loser in this film, but instead a fully functioning adult who gradually descends into a bottomless abyss as vices chip away at his ability to be any bit functional. The long regurgitated suffering and the eventual triumph from it makes you a breathe sigh of relief, although the last 10 min of the movie slowly crash into a contrived ending. Telugu cinema ought to take a turn here.<br>2017 - <strong>Ninnu Kori **- Telugu movies usually suffer from just the hero being multi dimensional characters. Rest of the characters only exist to prop up the hero. The characters in this movie are a pleasant exception. Every character tries to enrich their surroundings by doing the best they can, given their rashoman view of things. I wish more characters are flushed as fully as this one.<br>2018 - **Rangasthalam</strong> - A richly made period piece set in 1980s rural Andhra. Ram Charan stops imitating his dad. Sukumar deftly explores a lot of great story point possibilities with a deaf protagonist. The movie takes the title from the famous <em>Harischandra Padyamulu</em> by Jashuva. (‚Äú<em>Idi pisaachulatho Nitaalekshanandu gajja kadalanchi aadu <strong>**rangasthalamu</strong></em>‚Äù). Props to Sukumar for such a great title. Thoroughly entertaining. Telugu cinema seems to have taken a turn. Arjun Reddy was not an outlier.<br>2018 - <strong>Mahanati</strong> - Very rarely, do Telugu movies delve into character analysis nor biographies. This one makes a comfortable living in the shrink space. With a great canvas in 8-bit pastel colors, accompanied by a very charming Duleqar Salman, Keerthy Suresh breathes life into Savitri in not just the famous re-created movie scenes, but also a lot of the behind the scenes, which nobody has ever witnessed. Yet, you know that‚Äôs how the great diva must have lived it. But, that said, movie never really completely transports you into that golden era in spite of all the extraordinary detail to props, sets, costumes etc - mainly because of atrocious accents and diction and a lack of a deep bench of talented actors (who have not been typecast). Consequently, the wide array of Illuminati of the that generation remain cardboard cutouts than actual living legends. It must obviously be cheaper and affordable to throw money at props than to actually inspire and commit actors to get to learn Telugu accent and diction from 1960s. (Surprisingly, the sparse Tamil in the movie sounds reasonable.) Nonetheless, A very bold and entertaining attempt by the director and the producers. Expect more mainstream biopics about NTR, ANR, SVR, former politicians etc, but more hagiography than biography.<br>2018 - <strong>‚ÑÖ Kancharlapalem</strong> - Love Actually set in rural/semi-urban Andhra. The era of Small budget movies with hand held cameras and non-star casting opens up in Telugu cinema.<br>2019 - <strong>Mallesham</strong> - A biopic of a weaver-engineer set in rural Telangana. Apart from some wonderful casting, the film strives to showcase a wide array of Telangana culture from hardcore rural slang to Goreti Venkanna songs to burrakatha to Telangana customs.<br>2019 - <strong>Brochevarevarura</strong> - Kauffman arrives in Telugu, usherhing in a new genre: all-story-lines-lead-to-Rome-some-choking-up-fallopian-tubes-but-eventually-go-their-happy-way genre.<br>2020 - <strong>Ala Vaikuntapuramulo</strong> - Nothing really outlier about the movie, except Trivikram Srinivas used a Pothana Padyam for the title. Gotta see if that sets in a new reflection into Telugu heritage<br>2020 - <strong>Colour Photo</strong> - Slow paced narration for telugu audience is a feat all by itself.</p>
